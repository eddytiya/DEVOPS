containerizing microservice project


microservice is used to deliver features to users quickly and efficiently

we have 4 services in here
1.nginx:-api gateway
        -frontend from where all communication betweenw other servicesa re carried thru
        -it carries communication thru the url or paths

    if request comes from /(root) it will send it to the client microservice (2.angular):angular loads the frontend pages for the website
    for backend ata it is going to contact emart api (3.nodejs) using db 
    also 4.book api using java



its source code is on github:https://github.com/devopshydclub/emartapp

so we will clone its source code go thru its docker file and docker compose file

open the fithub in the emart file


create a new dir and clone it
adity@DESKTOP-GS354MB MINGW64 /d/docker
$ cd /d/emart

adity@DESKTOP-GS354MB MINGW64 /d/emart
$ git clone git@github.com:devopshydclub/emartapp.git
                           OR
adity@DESKTOP-GS354MB MINGW64 /d/emart
$ git clone https://github.com/devopshydclub/emartapp.git


adity@DESKTOP-GS354MB MINGW64 /d/emart
$
(this will open vs code in the current dir)
