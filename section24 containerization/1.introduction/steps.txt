containerization of application

SCENARIO

SUPPOSE U HAVE MANY SERVICES RUNNING ON AN APPLICATION STACK
AND THESE SERVICES ARE RUNNUNG ON VMS
AND WE NEED TO DO CONTINOUS CHANGES AND DEPLOYEMNST


PROBLEMS
-A LOT OF MONEY
-HUMAN ERRORS IN DEPLOYMENT
-NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE
-RESOURCE WASTAGE
-NOT PORTABLE ,DOES NOT SYNC WITH ENV



SOLUTION
-CONTAINERS
 CONSUMES LOW RESOURCE
 SUITS VERY WELL FOR MICROSERVICE DESIGN

-DEPLOYMENT VIA IMAGES
-SAME CONTAINER IMAGES ACROSS ENVIRONMENT
-REUSABLE AND REPEATABLE


WE ARE GOING TO USE DOCKER AS OUR EONTAINERIZATION ENV





STEPS

.STEPS TO SETUP OUR STACK SERVICES
.FIND RIGHT BASE IMAGE FROM DOCKERHUB
.WRITE A DOCKER IMAGE TO CUSTOMIZE IMAGES
.WRITE DOCKER-COMPOSE.YAML FILE TO RUN MULTICONTAINERS
.TEST IT AND HOST IMAGES ON DOCKER HUB




ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN


FETCH SOURCE CODE FROM GIT REPO
.
.
.
.

WE HAVE nGINX.tOMCAT AND MYSQL SO WE WRITE 3 DOCKERFILES
.
.
.
.
WE WILL USE DOCKER BUILD CMD USING THE BASE IMAGE WHICH WE ARE GOING TO BUILD
.
.
.
.
DOCKER COMPOSE WE ARE GOING TO TEST BY METIONING ALL THE CONTAINERS WITH THEIR IMAGES
.
.
.
.
ONCE DONE WE ARE GOING TO PUSH IT ONTO THE DOCKER HUB
